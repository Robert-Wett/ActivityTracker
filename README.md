## Using Node.js, implement a simple HTTP API service for tracking user activity for a mobile app. 
The basic mechanics for user activity are already handled by the app:

  - Each user has its own globally unique `user identifier` assigned by the app;

  - Every time a user opens the app on his device, a new user session is started;

  - Each new session is assigned a `session identifier` (generated by the app) when it starts;

  - Each session identifier is guaranteed to be unique for that user, but may not be unique across different users.

### Immediately after a session is started and its identifier generated, the app sends an "activity" event (i.e. an HTTP request)

to the API you are implementing through the following endpoint:

### `POST /activity`

  - The request body is a JSON-encoded object with the following keys:

    • `user_id` (string): the globally unique identifier of the user that opened the app;

    • `session_id` (string): the identifier of the user's new session;

### Your API should also be able to calculate some meaningful statistics for a specified date range:

  - the number of *unique* users seen in that time period. Unique means if a user opens the app more than once in that time period, it is only counted once. 

  - the number of sessions seen in that time period;

  - the average number of sessions per user in time period.

The endpoint for this is:

### `GET /stats` 

  - Requests must include the `start_date` (inclusive) and `end_date` (inclusive) query parameters to filter the data:

    • dates are specified in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g. January 23rd 2016 is written as 2016-01-23);

  - Requests may also include an optional `user_id` query parameter to filter the response to a single user identifier;

  - The response body should be a JSON-encoded string with the following format:

    • `unique_users` (integer): number of unique users in the given time period;

    • `num_sessions` (integer): number of sessions in the given time period (or all time if no period is passed);

### Key requirements:

  - Your code should start an HTTP web server that exposes the two endpoints described above and handles the requests accordingly;

  - Your code must be written in either JavaScript or CoffeeScript and should compile and run on a standard Node.js environment;

  - **This API must be built without using any pre-existing database management systems:**

    • That means no SQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Elastic, Redis, Memcache, etc.;

  - **Your system should be fault-tolerant:**

    • If the process is killed it can be restarted with no (or minimal) loss of data;

  - Your system should be able to store and query the user activity events for the next 5 years;

  - The mobile app has about 1 million active daily users, that number is not expected to change in the next 5 years;

  - Each user opens the app twice a day on average, generating two new sessions and the corresponding activity events;

```
